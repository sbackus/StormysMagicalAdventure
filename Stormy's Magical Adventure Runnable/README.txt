Stormy's Magical Adventure
(October 1 2016)

Stormy's Magical Adventure is playable a 2-D dialogue based role playing game featuring animations and character movement.  

The game itself is based on the Colleges of the Fenway.
Each character represents the mascot and what we thought were the attributes common to students of each college. 
For instance the Wentworth Institute of Technology mascot is a leopard, so we created Leopold the Leopard who's a Wentworth Computer Science major.  

Our protagonist is Stormy the Shark, the mascot of Simmons college.  We created a level for each mascot. 
Essentially, Stormy goes up to each character and notices that they're upset.
Then Stormy helps them answer a question thereby calming them down and completing their part of the story.  

We coded the entire game in Java and stored all the images as .png files that we imported into the game. 

It used Slick2D library as the base for the program.
The game features several classes and game mode switches to implement the variety of action and dialogue with different scenes.
